# PropulsionBasic
This program does simple calculations relating to velocity, speed and momentum. This was initially made for practice, I often make simple programs during my free time for practice but I sought to release this to the public. Just in-case if anyone wants to use it.

--Notes--

I planned on making this look good visually using the GTK 3 library for C but
I haven't got the library to work with Codeblocks properly, so I am just using
the default console app GUI, sorry :(.

--Contact Info--
